# TFE_Malware_Visualization_and_Classification
This master thesis is interested in two steps :
1) The generation of new visualization methods for malwares and cleanwares, fast and memory-saver, using only raw sample data
2) The classification of malwares using the visualizations and MLP or CNN as classifier

For the experiments, different datasets have been used, their structure and their behavior on the results have been analyzed and we tried to add cleanwares to see the results.
